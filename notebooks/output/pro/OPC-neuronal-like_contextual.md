### 1. Developmental and Cell State Properties

- **Progenitor-like/Stemness Features:** Genes such as **HMGA2** and **MET** are associated with stemness and progenitor cell identity. **HMGA2** is a chromatin remodeler highly expressed in neural stem cells and during CNS development; it promotes self-renewal and is commonly upregulated in aggressive, stem-like tumor cells. **MET** is a receptor tyrosine kinase that supports proliferation, survival, and migration in stem/progenitor populations. Their co-expression suggests these glioblastoma cells retain stem-like, undifferentiated features, similar to those seen in **oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs)** and **neural progenitors**[3][4][5].

- **OPC-Neuronal Signature:** Several genes (**CNTNAP5, TENM2, GRM7, DPP10**) contribute to neuronal or glial lineage programs.
   - **CNTNAP5** and **TENM2** encode cell adhesion and signaling molecules involved in axon guidance and synaptic organization, both relevant for neuronal and glial progenitor migration during neurodevelopment.
   - **DPP10** and **GRM7** are implicated in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, underlining a possible acquisition of neuronal-like activity in malignant cells[1][3].
   - This hybrid gene signature aligns with observations that glioblastoma can adopt a range of lineage programs, including **neuronal and OPC-like states**, often reflecting increased plasticity and adaptability[3][4].

- **Plasticity and Heterogeneity:** The expression of these markers matches single-cell analyses showing that **progenitor-like, transcriptionally plastic states** (OPC-like, neuronal-like) are enriched at the tumor margins and in recurrent GBM, likely contributing to resistance and infiltration[3][4].

### 2. Functional Properties and Metabolic Features

- **Cell Migration and Invasion:** Genes such as **MET, EPHA3, POSTN,** and **TENM2** are key drivers of cellular motility:
   - **MET** and **EPHA3** regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, cell scattering, and response to environmental cues.
   - **POSTN (Periostin)** is an extracellular matrix protein that promotes cell adhesion, migration, and tissue remodeling, supporting invasive tumor behavior and interactions with the brain microenvironment.
   - **TENM2** and **CNTNAP5** facilitate axon guidance and cell–cell recognition, potentially aiding tumor cell dispersion via neural tracts[2][3].

- **Cell–Cell and Tumor–Neuron Interactions:** The presence of **GRM7** (a metabotropic glutamate receptor), **VGF** (a neuropeptide precursor involved in neuron–glia communication and synaptic plasticity), and **CNTNAP5** suggests these malignant glioblastoma cells may participate in or mimic neuronal signaling.
   - Recent studies reveal that GBM cells can exhibit **neuronal excitability or co-opt neuronal signaling** to promote growth, invasion, and possibly integration into neural circuits[1][3].
   - These interactions may also contribute to **peritumoral hyperexcitability** and even epileptiform activity in patients, reflecting a broader cross-talk between tumor and normal neural cells.

- **Metabolic and Microenvironmental Adaptation:** Genes such as **CPM** (carboxypeptidase M) can support metabolic adaptation and the processing of signaling peptides, while **VGF** may indicate adaptation to nutritional or trophic factors in the tumor microenvironment.

### 3. Normal Cell–Cell Interactions and Developmental Pathways

- **Neural Circuit Integration:** In normal development, **GRM7**, **DPP10**, **TENM2**, and **CNTNAP5** participate in fine-tuning neural connectivity, axon guidance, and synaptic function, all essential for proper CNS wiring. Their expression in GBM cells suggests a hijacking of these developmental programs to facilitate tumor spread and communication with neighboring neural elements.

- **OPC and Neuron Crosstalk:** OPCs naturally interact with neurons to receive synaptic input and regulate their own proliferation and differentiation. Malignant cells expressing this gene set may use similar mechanisms to sense and respond to neuronal activity, leveraging **neuronal–glial synapses** for growth cues or survival, a phenomenon increasingly recognized in glioma biology[1][3].

In summary, this gene signature reflects a **highly plastic, progenitor-like and invasive cell state** in glioblastoma, with evidence of **neuronal and glial lineage mimicry, increased cell–cell interaction capacity (notably with neurons), and adaptability to microenvironmental cues**. These cells likely leverage both **normal developmental pathways** and **cancer-specific adaptations** to drive tumor progression, resistance, and invasion[1][2][3][4][5].
