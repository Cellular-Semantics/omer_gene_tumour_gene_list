Query: The following is a list of genes enriched in tumour microenvironment cells from a (human) patient with glioblastoma  annotated as Vascular-associated.  What might this list say about the state, properties and interactions of this cell type?  Do not limit your answers to the cancer literature,  include normal cell-cell interactions, development and cross-cutting metabolic states.  Gene list: ['RBMS3', 'IGFBP7', 'PTPRG', 'TIMP3', 'LHFPL6', 'COBLL1', 'EPAS1', 'CALD1', 'PTPRM', 'LAMA2']

The provided **gene list**—*RBMS3, IGFBP7, PTPRG, TIMP3, LHFPL6, COBLL1, EPAS1, CALD1, PTPRM, LAMA2*—enriched in vascular-associated cells within the glioblastoma tumour microenvironment, indicates a population with properties reminiscent of **vascular endothelial and mural cells** (such as pericytes and smooth muscle) and their roles in **angiogenesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, signaling, and adaptation to hypoxia**. Below is an analysis of what these genes suggest regarding the state, properties, and interactions of these cells, connecting both tumoural and physiological contexts:

**1. Angiogenesis and Vascular Remodeling**
- **EPAS1 (HIF2A)** encodes a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor central to the cellular response to low oxygen, promoting angiogenesis by upregulating genes like VEGF and others crucial for new blood vessel formation. Its expression signals a hypoxic and pro-angiogenic environment, common in glioblastoma and also physiological processes such as embryonic vascular development[2].
- **IGFBP7** modulates angiogenesis by binding IGFs and contributing to endothelial cell senescence, migration, and vessel stabilization. It has both tumour-suppressive and pro-angiogenic effects, depending on context.
- **TIMP3** is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in ECM degradation during vessel sprouting and repair. TIMP3 regulates angiogenesis by maintaining ECM integrity and directly modulating VEGF signaling.

**2. ECM Sensing, Remodeling, and Adhesion**
- **LAMA2** encodes a laminin alpha chain, a key ECM glycoprotein in the basement membrane, essential for vessel stability, endothelial–pericyte interactions, and tissue architecture.
- **CALD1 (Caldesmon)** is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation within smooth muscle and pericytes, contributing to vessel tone, stabilization, and migration.
- **COBLL1** has been implicated in cytoskeletal organization and may play a role in endothelial cell shape and motility, influencing capillary morphogenesis.

**3. Cell–Cell and Cell–Matrix Communication**
- **PTPRG and PTPRM** are receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases, modulating cell–cell contact, particularly in the vascular endothelium and pericytes. They influence barrier properties, vascular permeability, and possibly endothelial–tumour cell cross-talk.
- **RBMS3** is a nucleic acid binding protein suggested to regulate gene expression programs that impact vascular cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly during development and in response to injury or hypoxia.

**4. Vascular Development and Differentiation**
- The combination of *RBMS3, LAMA2, CALD1, EPAS1*, and *COBLL1* points to programs active not only in tumoural angiogenesis but also in normal vessel formation and maintenance, such as during embryonic development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration[3].

**5. Tumour Microenvironment Interactions**
- In glioblastoma, these genes highlight the adaptation of vascular-associated cells to a hypoxic, growth factor-rich, and ECM-dynamic environment. They likely contribute to **abnormal vessel architecture**, increased permeability, and the creation of niches supporting tumour growth and immune cell infiltration[2].
- Some genes (*TIMP3, IGFBP7*) can also **modulate immune cell entry** and phenotype, influencing the inflammatory milieu in both cancer and normal physiology.

**6. Cross-cutting Metabolic and Stress States**
- Upregulation of **EPAS1** and ECM-related genes aligns with metabolic adaptation to hypoxia and oxidative stress—features shared by tumour vessels and physiologically stressed or developing tissues.

**Conclusion:**  
These genes together describe a vascular cell population that is **reactive, proliferative, and structurally dynamic**, with capacity for **angiogenesis, ECM interaction, and adaptation to metabolic stress**, relevant both to tumour progression and normal vessel biology. Their expression profile is consistent with the complex interplay between **endothelial cells, pericytes, ECM, and the hypoxic tumour microenvironment**, reflecting both pathological (glioblastoma angiogenesis/invasion) and physiological (developmental/de novo vessel formation) paradigms.
