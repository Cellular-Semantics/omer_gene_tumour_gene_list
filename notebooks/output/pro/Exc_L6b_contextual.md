Query: The following is a list of genes enriched in tumour microenvironment cells from a (human) patient with glioblastoma  annotated as Neurons (Exc).  What might this list say about the state, properties and interactions of this cell type?  Do not limit your answers to the cancer literature,  include normal cell-cell interactions, development and cross-cutting metabolic states.

The **gene list** you provided—ROBO2, KIAA1217, DPP10, FRMPD4, CACNA2D3, SYT1, FAM155A, MDGA2, KALRN, RALYL—annotated as “Neurons (Exc)” in the glioblastoma microenvironment, points to a population of **excitatory neurons** with preserved and potentially specialized roles in signaling, structural connectivity, and interaction with the local environment. Here’s what their collective enrichment suggests about their state, properties, and interactions:

---

**1. Axon Guidance and Neuronal Connectivity**

- **ROBO2** is a major axon guidance receptor involved in steering axons during neural development, controlling neuronal wiring, and ensuring proper formation of brain circuits[1][2][3]. Its presence indicates active or preserved guidance processes, potentially even in the adult tumor microenvironment, and may reflect ongoing remodeling or recruitment of neuronal projections.
- Genes like **KALRN** (encoding kalirin, a Rho-GEF) and **MDGA2** (involved in synaptic development and adhesion) further support roles in neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine formation, and synaptic specification, which are essential both during development and for plasticity in adult neural networks.

**2. Synaptic Function and Excitability**

- **SYT1** (Synaptotagmin-1) is a critical calcium sensor for synaptic vesicle fusion, underlying fast neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses. This suggests these cells are functionally competent for rapid synaptic transmission.
- **CACNA2D3** encodes an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels that modulate calcium influx during neuronal firing, affecting neurotransmitter release and excitability.
- **DPP10** modulates potassium channel activity, influencing action potential properties and neuronal firing rates.

**3. Cell-Cell Communication, Adhesion, and Microenvironmental Interactions**

- **MDGA2** and **FRMPD4** are implicated in cell adhesion, synaptic scaffolding, and dendritic spine morphogenesis, pointing to active participation in synaptic networks and possibly altered synaptic architecture in the tumor microenvironment.
- **KIAA1217** is less well characterized, but evidence links it to neuronal migration and axon tract formation.

**4. Potential Developmental and Plasticity-Related States**

- The enrichment of genes typically involved in embryonic or early postnatal neurodevelopment (such as axon guidance and synaptogenesis genes) may indicate that these neurons retain or reacquire a "developmentally plastic" phenotype, possibly reflecting adaptation to signals from the tumor microenvironment or regenerative attempts in response to injury or remodeling.
- This plasticity can include axon retraction, sprouting, and even synaptic rewiring, which have been documented in peritumoral brain regions.

**5. Metabolic and Regulatory Potential**

- **FAM155A** and **RALYL** are less understood but are expressed in the brain. FAM155A may be involved in ion channel function, while RALYL, an RNA-binding protein, could play a regulatory role in mRNA stability or translation, impacting neuronal metabolism or responsiveness to environmental cues.

---

**Functional and Interaction Implications:**

- **Signal Integration:** These neurons are likely to be highly responsive to both intrinsic signals (e.g., synaptic input) and extrinsic cues (e.g., guidance molecules from other cells, including glia and possibly tumor cells), facilitating dynamic network changes.
- **Tumor Microenvironment Interactions:** Some axon guidance and cell adhesion molecules (like ROBO2, MDGA2) have been implicated in neuron-tumor crosstalk; neuronal processes can influence glioma growth and invasion, and vice versa. The presence of these genes may reflect active communication or modulation by the tumor.
- **Neuronal Health and Stress:** Expression of developmentally regulated and activity-dependent genes in peri-tumoral neurons may also reflect responses to injury, hypoxia, or altered extracellular matrix associated with tumor growth.

**In summary:**  
This gene expression signature suggests the annotated neurons are **structurally and functionally plastic excitatory neurons**, likely capable of forming and remodeling synaptic connections, responding dynamically to both developmental and microenvironmental cues—including those arising from the glioblastoma. Their repertoire points to active roles in signaling, network architecture, and potentially tumor–neuron interactions or adaptations to stress and injury. These features are relevant for both normal brain function and the altered cellular landscape of brain tumors[1][2][3].
