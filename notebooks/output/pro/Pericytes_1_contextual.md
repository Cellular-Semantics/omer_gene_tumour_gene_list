Query: The following is a list of genes enriched in tumour microenvironment cells from a (human) patient with glioblastoma  annotated as Vascular-associated.  What might this list say about the state, properties and interactions of this cell type?  Do not limit your answers to the cancer literature,  include normal cell-cell interactions, development and cross-cutting metabolic states.  Gene list: ['IGFBP7', 'EBF1', 'CALD1', 'PRKG1', 'FN1', 'COBLL1', 'COL4A2', 'ITGA1', 'RBMS3', 'SLC38A11']

The **genes enriched in vascular-associated cells** from the glioblastoma microenvironment, namely: IGFBP7, EBF1, CALD1, PRKG1, FN1, COBLL1, COL4A2, ITGA1, RBMS3, and SLC38A11, collectively provide insight into the *state*, *properties*, and *interactions* of these cells, both within cancer and in normal physiology:

**1. Vascular Identity and Function**
- **FN1 (Fibronectin 1)**, **COL4A2 (Collagen Type IV Alpha 2)**, and **ITGA1 (Integrin alpha 1)** are classical components and receptors of the **vascular extracellular matrix (ECM)**. Their coordinated expression supports roles in **basement membrane assembly**, **angiogenesis**, and **cell-matrix adhesion**.
    - *FN1* promotes cell adhesion and migration during vessel development and repair.
    - *COL4A2* is a structural element of the vascular basement membrane, essential for vessel integrity and selective permeability.
    - *ITGA1* mediates cell–ECM interactions, particularly with collagens, facilitating vascular cell signaling and stabilization.
- **IGFBP7 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7)** is associated with **modulation of angiogenesis** and is often expressed in endothelial cells and pericytes. Notably, in tumors, IGFBP7 can act as an anti-angiogenic factor, but in some contexts, it also promotes vascular normalization.

**2. Vascular Cell State and Plasticity**
- **CALD1 (Caldesmon 1)** and **PRKG1 (Protein Kinase, cGMP-Dependent, Type I)** are markers of **contractile function** in vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes.
    - *CALD1* regulates actin–myosin interactions required for vessel tone and remodeling.
    - *PRKG1* is a major effector of nitric oxide signaling, crucial for vascular relaxation and control of blood flow.
- **COBLL1 (Cordon-Bleu WH2 Repeat Protein Like 1)**, though less characterized, is linked to cytoskeletal regulation, which may be involved in dynamic shape changes during angiogenesis or vessel stability.
- **RBMS3 (RNA Binding Motif Single Stranded Interacting Protein 3)** is implicated in the negative regulation of cell proliferation and has recently been identified in endothelial cell differentiation, potentially linking to vessel maturation or stabilization.

**3. Developmental and Cell–Cell Interactions**
- **EBF1 (Early B-cell Factor 1)** is a transcription factor known mainly for its role in B-cell lineage specification, but it also appears in stromal cells of the bone marrow and may play a role in mesenchymal or perivascular cell identity, supporting cell–cell communication during vasculature development.
- **SLC38A11 (Solute Carrier Family 38 Member 11)** is a putative amino acid transporter, suggesting a link to metabolic adaptation in the vascular niche, likely involved in supplying nutrients or responding to hypoxia common in tumor environments.

**Implications for Properties and Interactions**
- **Angiogenesis and Vessel Remodeling**: The gene set suggests active **angiogenic remodeling**. Increased ECM components, contractile machinery, and signaling molecules indicate ongoing vessel sprouting or stabilization, processes hijacked in glioblastoma to support tumor growth and survival.
- **Barrier and Perivascular Characteristics**: The presence of collagen IV and integrins alludes to a well-developed or maturing **vascular basement membrane**, important for the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and may also reflect **pericyte** or **vascular smooth muscle cell** recruitment.
- **Cross-talk and Cell Plasticity**: Expression of factors like IGFBP7 and EBF1 suggests these cells may **modulate immune cell recruitment**, participate in vessel co-option, or transdifferentiate in response to local cues (as observed in both normal development and tumor angiogenesis).
- **Metabolic State**: The enrichment of SLC38A11 hints at **adaptation to altered metabolic demands**, likely due to hypoxia or nutrient stress in the tumor microenvironment, paralleling similar responses seen in wound healing or development.

**Conclusion**  
The collective expression profile of these genes signifies a **vascular-associated cell population** in glioblastoma that is highly engaged in ECM production, **vessel maturation/remodeling**, and metabolic adaptation. These features reflect both *normal roles* in vascular development and maintenance, and the *altered states* present in the tumor microenvironment, where such programs are co-opted to sustain tumor expansion, immune modulation, and resistance to therapy. This gene signature could mark a heterogeneous population encompassing **endothelial cells, pericytes, and possibly vascular smooth muscle cells** at various stages of activation or differentiation, dynamically interacting with both tumor and immune cells.
