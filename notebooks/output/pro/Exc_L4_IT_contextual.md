This list of genes enriched in tumour microenvironment cells annotated as **Neurons (Exc)** in a glioblastoma patient provides insights into the **state, function, and interactions** of these cells. Here's what the enrichment profile suggests, based on major literature and broad biological principles:

**Key Genes and Their Implications:**

- **TSHZ2**: A transcription factor known to be involved in forebrain and neocortex development. Its expression indicates a commitment to neuronal lineages and may also influence neuronal identity and connectivity during development and in adult brain homeostasis.

- **PTPRT**: This gene encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, highly expressed in the brain, crucial for synapse formation and maintenance, and involved in regulating neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. It may also play a role in limiting inappropriate neuronal excitation and supporting correct circuit wiring.

- **RMST**: An essential long non-coding RNA for neuronal development, acting as a transcriptional co-regulator of SOX2. RMST influences neuronal lineage specification and is necessary for the maturation and migration of neural precursors, such as those giving rise to GnRH neurons[1][2][3][4]. Its loss impairs neurodevelopment, cell proliferation, and migration, and is linked to clinical disorders like Kallmann Syndrome and Hirschsprung disease, highlighting its role in both normal and pathological neurogenesis[1][2][3][4].

- **PLCH1**: Encodes a phospholipase C isotype, involved in intracellular signaling pathways that modulate synaptic activity and plasticity, necessary for neurotransmission and possibly for activity-dependent neural modulation.

- **RALYL**: A RNA-binding protein with enriched expression in neural tissues, implicated in post-transcriptional regulation and neural differentiation.

- **KCNIP4**: Modulates A-type potassium channels, strongly affecting neuronal excitability and firing patterns. Expressed in excitatory neurons, it participates in the fine-tuning of action potential propagation and neuron responsiveness.

- **MGAT4C**: Involved in protein glycosylation; while less specifically neural, glycosylation is critical for protein folding, trafficking, and cell-cell interactions, possibly affecting cell adhesion and synaptic surface protein function.

- **CNTN5**: A cell adhesion molecule of the contactin family, involved in **axon guidance, neurite outgrowth**, and synaptic plasticity. It plays a central role in establishing and maintaining synaptic connections in excitatory circuits.

- **DPP10**: Modulates voltage-gated potassium channels, contributing to neuronal excitability and firing precision, particularly in rapidly spiking excitatory neurons.

- **IQCJ-SCHIP1**: Fusion gene/proteins implicated in cytoskeletal organization and axonal growth, potentially affecting axonal pathfinding and synaptic architecture.

**Interpretation:**

1. **Excitatory Neuronal Identity:**  
   The gene profile is highly indicative of **mature excitatory neurons**, with enrichment for genes involved in synaptic transmission (PLCH1, DPP10, KCNIP4), axonal guidance and synaptic connectivity (CNTN5, TSHZ2), and neuronal gene regulation (RMST, RALYL).

2. **Developmental Activity and Neurogenesis:**  
   The presence of **RMST** and **TSHZ2** suggests these cells may retain or reactivate certain developmental programs. In the context of the tumour microenvironment, this could reflect ongoing neurogenesis, dedifferentiation, or a response to injury/tumour-induced plasticity[1][2][3][4].

3. **Synaptic Plasticity and Circuit Modulation:**  
   Genes like **PTPRT, DPP10, and KCNIP4** point towards active modulation of synaptic strength and network excitability. This supports the hypothesis that these neurons could be involved in local circuit rewiring, adaptation to the tumour microenvironment, or even pathological hyperexcitability.

4. **Cell-Cell and Cell-Environment Interactions:**  
   **CNTN5 and MGAT4C** are associated with cell adhesion and glycoprotein modification, respectively, facilitating interactions with glia, other neurons, or infiltrating immune cells. In the tumour context, such genes could mediate altered cross-talk with tumour or stromal cells, influencing immune evasion, axon guidance, or niche maintenance.

5. **Plasticity and Pathological States:**  
   The expression of these developmental and plasticity-related genes suggests that **neurons in the tumour microenvironment may be in a heightened state of plasticity**, possibly responding to local injury, inflammation, or signals from tumour cells. This aligns with evidence that gliomas can induce neural remodeling, synaptic reorganization, and even recruit or reprogram neurons and neural precursors.

**Beyond Cancer:**

- **Normal cell-cell interactions:** Many of these genes, particularly CNTN5, KCNIP4, and PLCH1, are crucial for healthy synaptic formation and function, suggesting these neurons likely maintain some homeostatic roles within the TME.
- **Developmental context:** Genes like RMST, TSHZ2, and RALYL are also essential during neural development, reflecting either ongoing neurogenesis, a retained immature phenotype, or response to regenerative cues.
- **Metabolic and regulatory states:** The involvement of MGAT4C and RALYL hints at potential adjustments in protein processing, glycosylation, and RNA metabolism, which are important for rapid adaptation and synaptic remodeling.

Overall, this gene signature reflects **excitatory neurons with a developmental/plastic phenotype**, engaged in active synaptic signaling, possibly responding to or altered by the tumour milieu, and poised for interactions with other neural, glial, or tumoural elements. The functional themes include neural development, electrical excitability, cell-cell adhesion, and dynamic adaptation, all relevant both in normal physiology and in the context of cancer and tissue remodeling[1][2][3][4].
