# contextual query Proliferative AC-OPC-like

Query: The following is a list of genes enriched in Malignant cells from a (human) patient with glioblastoma  annotated as Proliferative.  What might this list say about the state, properties and interactions of this cell type?  Do not limit your answers to the cancer literature,  include normal cell-cell interactions, development and cross-cutting metabolic states.  Gene list: ['DIAPH3', 'MIR924HG', 'TOP2A', 'ASPM', 'CENPF', 'APOLD1', 'CENPE', 'MELK', 'CEP135', 'SPC24']

The gene list you provided—**DIAPH3, MIR924HG, TOP2A, ASPM, CENPF, APOLD1, CENPE, MELK, CEP135, SPC24**—is highly indicative of a **proliferative state** in malignant glioblastoma cells. This gene signature provides insights beyond oncology, touching on normal developmental biology, cell-cell interactions, and potentially altered metabolic states.

**Key themes and implications from the gene list:**

- **Cell Cycle and Mitosis:**  
  Multiple genes in this list are central to **cell cycle progression and mitosis**.  
  - **TOP2A** encodes DNA topoisomerase II alpha, a key enzyme that manages DNA topology during replication and is a hallmark of proliferating cells in both normal development (e.g., neural progenitors) and cancer.
  - **ASPM, CENPF, CENPE, SPC24, CEP135** are all directly involved in spindle assembly, centrosome function, or kinetochore dynamics. In development, these genes are typically upregulated in **neural progenitor cells** where rapid cell division is critical for brain growth; their overexpression in glioblastoma marks the hijacking of developmental programs to sustain uncontrolled proliferation.
  - **MELK** (Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase) regulates cell cycle and is essential in **neural stem/progenitor cell maintenance** and division, as well as in cancer stem-like cells. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma and with stemness traits.

- **Cytoskeleton and Morphology:**  
  - **DIAPH3** is an actin nucleator involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in cell migration and polarity. In normal tissues, it plays a role in neurite outgrowth and **cell-cell contacts**, while in tumors, its dysregulation can enhance both **migration and invasiveness**.
  - **APOLD1** modulates endothelial cell function and **vascular permeability**. In healthy tissue, it participates in blood-brain barrier integrity and neurovascular coupling; in a tumor context, it may facilitate tumor angiogenesis or alter the interactions between malignant and normal stromal cells.

- **Non-coding RNA and Regulation:**  
  - **MIR924HG** is a host gene for a microRNA. While specific functions in glioblastoma are less clear, long noncoding RNAs and microRNA host genes frequently modulate gene expression involved in **differentiation, proliferation, and cell signaling** both in development and disease contexts.

**Biological state and properties reflected:**

- The gene set is characteristic of *highly proliferative, mitotically active, and possibly stem-like cells*.  
- Reflects reactivation of **developmental gene regulatory networks**, especially those seen in neural progenitors, aligning with the known dedifferentiated and stem-like properties attributed to aggressive glioblastoma subsets.
- Indicates potential for **cellular plasticity**—these cells may not only proliferate rapidly but also possess attributes supporting migration (via cytoskeletal regulators like DIAPH3) and interaction with the tumor microenvironment (via APOLD1).
- Suggests **increased vulnerability to mitotic stress**—these cells may rely heavily on mitotic regulators and could be susceptible to drugs targeting spindle or centrosome function, an observation exploited in both cancer therapy and developmental biology research.

**Cell-cell Interactions and Developmental Crosstalk:**

- In normal development, several of these genes mediate **cell division orientation, interkinetic nuclear migration, and tissue architecture**, fundamental for forming the organized structures of the brain.
- Dysregulation may disrupt normal cell-cell contacts and polarity, which in a tumor milieu, may facilitate **invasiveness** and resistance to growth constraints imposed by surrounding tissue.

**Metabolic implications:**

- Rapidly dividing cells, including those expressing this gene set, have increased demand for nucleotides, energy, and biomass, typically showing high rates of **aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect)**, enhanced ribosome biogenesis, and upregulated nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis.
