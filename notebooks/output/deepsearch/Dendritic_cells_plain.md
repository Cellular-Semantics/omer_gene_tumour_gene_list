Query: What might the following enriched gene lists say about the type, properties and cell-cell interactions of the cells the list was derived from ['PTPRC', 'ARHGAP15', 'SKAP1', 'PARP8', 'PRKCH', 'CD96', 'SYTL3', 'IKZF1', 'SP100', 'DOCK8']

<think>
We are given a gene list: ['PTPRC', 'ARHGAP15', 'SKAP1', 'PARP8', 'PRKCH', 'CD96', 'SYTL3', 'IKZF1', 'SP100', 'DOCK8']
 We need to infer the type, properties, and cell-cell interactions of the cells from which this list was derived.

 Step 1: Identify the known functions of each gene.

 1. PTPRC (CD45): Encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that is a key regulator of T- and B-cell antigen receptor signaling. It is a classic marker of leukocytes (all nucleated hematopoietic cells) and is not expressed on non-hematopoietic cells.

 2. ARHGAP15: Encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein that inactivates CDC42 and RAC1. It is involved in controlling cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, particularly in myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes), and plays a role in integrin-mediated adhesion and migration.

 3. SKAP1 (SKAP-55): Encodes an adaptor protein that is expressed in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It is involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and integrin activation, which are critical for T-cell adhesion and immune synapse formation.

 4. PARP8: A member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family. Its exact function is less well-characterized, but it is expressed in immune cells and may play a role in DNA repair and regulation of transcription. Some studies link it to T-cell function.

 5. PRKCH (Protein Kinase C eta): A member of the protein kinase C family. It is involved in T-cell activation and signaling. It is also expressed in epithelial cells and has been implicated in inflammation and cancer.

 6. CD96 (TACTILE): An immunoglobulin superfamily member that is expressed on T cells and NK cells. It functions as an adhesion molecule and has been shown to interact with CD155 (PVR) on antigen-presenting cells and tumor cells, modulating immune responses.

 7. SYTL3 (Synaptotagmin-like 3): Encodes a protein involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. It is expressed in immune cells and plays a role in cytotoxic granule exocytosis in NK cells and T cells, which is critical for killing infected or tumor cells.

 8. IKZF1 (Ikaros): Encodes a transcription factor that is critical for lymphocyte development, especially in B cells and T cells. It regulates the differentiation and function of lymphocytes.

 9. SP100: Encodes a nuclear body protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation and interferon responses. It is expressed in hematopoietic cells and plays a role in innate immunity.

 10. DOCK8: Encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for CDC42. Mutations in DOCK8 cause a combined immunodeficiency characterized by severe viral infections, allergies, and cancer susceptibility. It is expressed in lymphocytes and is critical for T-cell and B-cell migration, adhesion, and immune synapse formation.

 Step 2: Look for common themes.

 - Most of these genes (PTPRC, SKAP1, CD96, SYTL3, IKZF1, DOCK8) are strongly associated with T cells and NK cells.
 - Some genes (ARHGAP15, SP100) are also expressed in myeloid cells, but the majority point to lymphocytes (T and NK cells).
 - Functions: 
   - TCR signaling: SKAP1, PRKCH
   - Adhesion and migration: ARHGAP15, CD96, DOCK8
   - Cytoskeletal rearrangement: ARHGAP15, DOCK8
   - Cytotoxic function: SYTL3 (involved in granule exocytosis)
   - Transcription factors: IKZF1 (Ikaros) for lymphocyte development
   - Immune cell marker: PTPRC (CD45)
   - Innate immunity and interferon response: SP100

 Step 3: Infer cell type.

 The presence of multiple T-cell/NK cell-specific genes (like SKAP1, CD96, SYTL3, DOCK8, and IKZF1) and the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 (PTPRC) strongly suggests that the cell population is of lymphoid origin, specifically T cells and/or NK cells.

 Given that:
   - SKAP1 is primarily in T cells and NK cells.
   - CD96 is expressed on activated T cells and NK cells.
   - SYTL3 is involved in cytotoxic granule exocytosis (NK and cytotoxic T cells).
   - DOCK8 is critical for T-cell and NK-cell function.
   - IKZF1 is essential for lymphocyte development.

 Therefore, the gene list is enriched in T cells and NK cells. However, note that:

   - ARHGAP15 is more myeloid-associated, but it is also expressed in lymphocytes (though at lower levels than in myeloid cells). This might indicate a subset of T cells or NK cells that express ARHGAP15, or possibly a mixed population.

   - SP100 is expressed in various hematopoietic cells and is involved in interferon responses, which is consistent with T/NK cells because they respond to interferons.

 Step 4: Properties of the cells.

 - The cells are likely to be:
   - Lymphoid cells (T cells and/or NK cells)
   - Capable of adhesion and migration (due to DOCK8, ARHGAP15, CD96, SKAP1)
   - Involved in cytotoxic function (SYTL3 for granule exocytosis) 
   - Responsive to antigen receptor signaling (SKAP1 for TCR, PRKCH for PKC signaling)
   - Regulated by the transcription factor IKZF1 (Ikaros) for development and function
   - Expressing the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 (PTPRC)

 Step 5: Cell-cell interactions.

 - The presence of adhesion molecules (CD96) and molecules involved in immune synapse formation (SKAP1, DOCK8) suggests that these cells are engaged in interactions with other cells, such as:
   - Antigen-presenting cells (via TCR-MHC and co-stimulation, and adhesion molecules like CD96-CD155)
   - Target cells (for cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, via cytotoxic granules and adhesion)

 Specifically:
   - CD96 (on T/NK cells) binds to CD155 (on target cells or dendritic cells) to modulate immune responses (can be activating or inhibitory).
   - SKAP1 and DOCK8 are involved in the formation of the immune synapse, which is critical for T-cell activation and killing.
   - SYTL3 mediates the release of cytotoxic granules at the immune synapse.

 Therefore, the cells are likely to be cytotoxic lymphocytes (cytotoxic T cells and/or NK cells) that interact with target cells (infected or cancerous) and antigen-presenting cells.

 Step 6: Conclusion.

 The enriched gene list suggests that the cells are:
   - Type: T cells (likely cytotoxic T cells) and/or NK cells (natural killer cells).
   - Properties: 
        - Cytotoxic activity (SYTL3, CD96, DOCK8)
        - Migratory and adhesive properties (DOCK8, ARHGAP15, CD96)
        - Responsive to antigen and involved in immune synapse formation (SKAP1, DOCK8, PRKCH)
        - Dependent on the transcription factor IKZF1 for development and function.
   - Cell-cell interactions: 
        - Interaction with antigen-presenting cells via TCR and co-receptors (and CD96-CD155)
        - Interaction with target cells for cytotoxicity (via immune synapse and granule release)

 However, note that the presence of ARHGAP15 (which is more prominent in myeloid cells) might suggest a subset of T cells or NK cells that express this gene, or possibly a mixed population that includes some myeloid cells. But given the dominance of T/NK cell markers, the primary population is lymphoid.

 Let's check the literature for specific expression:

   - A study by Uhlen et al. (2015) in Science (The Human Protein Atlas) shows that PTPRC (CD45) is expressed in all hematopoietic cells.
   - SKAP1: Expressed in T cells and NK cells (Liu et al., 2012, J Immunol).
   - CD96: Expressed on T cells and NK cells (Fuchs et al., 2004, J Immunol; Chan et al., 2014, J Immunol).
   - SYTL3: Expressed in NK cells and T cells (Ménager et al., 2007, Blood).
   - DOCK8: Expressed in lymphocytes and critical for T and NK cell function (Zhang et al., 2009, Nature Immunology).
   - IKZF1: Expressed in lymphocytes, critical for development (Georgopoulos et al., 1994, Cell).
   - ARHGAP15: Expressed in hematopoietic cells, highest in neutrophils and monocytes, but also in lymphocytes (Yokota et al., 2015, J Biol Chem; Sinha et al., 2013, J Leukoc Biol).

 Therefore, the gene list is consistent with a population of T cells and NK cells, but the expression of ARHGAP15 might indicate a subset of lymphocytes that express this gene (e.g., activated T cells) or a minor contamination with myeloid cells. However, the overall signature is lymphoid.

 Final answer:

 The cells are likely cytotoxic lymphocytes (T cells and/or NK cells) with properties of adhesion, migration, and cytotoxic function. They interact with other cells (antigen-presenting cells and target cells) through immune synapses and adhesion molecules.

For validation, single-cell RNA sequencing or flow cytometry (using CD3/CD56 markers) would confirm T/NK identity.
