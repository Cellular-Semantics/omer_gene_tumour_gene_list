**Query:** 
> The following is a list of genes enriched in Malignant cells from a (human) patient with glioblastoma annotated as Astrocyte-gliosis-like. What might this list say about the state, properties and interactions of this cell type? Do not limit your answers to the cancer literature, include normal cell-cell interactions, development and cross-cutting metabolic states. Gene list: ['POSTN', 'JPH1', 'EYA4', 'RTN1', 'LAMA2', 'AC092957.1', 'TNC', 'IGFBP7', 'COL23A1', 'NAMPT']

**Response:**

The enriched gene list indicates that these malignant astrocyte‐gliosis–like glioblastoma cells occupy a hybrid biological state characterized by features of both reactive glial responses and aggressive cancer phenotypes ([1.1], [2.1], JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, NAMPT). Their expression profile suggests extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), altered cell adhesion dynamics, and active intercellular communication, which not only underlie tumor progression but also recapitulate developmental and injury‐induced gliotic responses ([3.1], [3.2]).

POSTN (periostin) is a central effector within this gene set and is well known for its role in promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance through pathways such as NF-κB activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ([2.1], JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, NAMPT, [4.1]). Its secretion by glioblastoma stem cells and its capacity to recruit pro-tumoral immune cells, particularly M2 macrophages, underscore its dual contribution to both tumor aggressiveness and modulation of the tumor microenvironment ([5.1], [5.2]).

JPH1, which is involved in membrane junction formation and intracellular signal transduction, potentially mediates enhanced cell–cell interactions that are crucial during normal development as well as in gliosis-like remodeling in the tumor context ([2.1], JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, NAMPT, [4.2]). EYA4, a gene with roles in development and tumor progression, likely contributes to the reactivation of developmental pathways in these malignant cells, possibly affecting cellular differentiation and survival ([2.1], JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, NAMPT, [3.2]). RTN1, associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and neural development, may reflect the adaptive responses of these cells under oncogenic and injury-stress conditions ([1.1], [3.2]).

ECM components play a critical role here; LAMA2 codes for laminin α2, a key adhesion molecule that is essential for neural development and synaptic organization, while TNC (tenascin C) is known for its functions in modulating cell adhesion, migration, and tissue remodeling during both normal brain development and gliosis ([1.1], [6.1]). COL23A1, a collagen variant, is likely involved in regulating ECM integrity and facilitating complex cell-matrix interactions that support both structural remodeling and invasion ([7.1], [7.2]). IGFBP7 modulates growth factor signaling and angiogenesis, bridging normal growth regulation with oncogenic processes in the tumor microenvironment ([7.2], [8.1]).

NAMPT, a key enzyme in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis, reflects a metabolic reprogramming that supports both survival and the high energetic demands of proliferating tumor cells, while also resembling metabolic adaptations seen in stressed or regenerating neural tissue ([3.3], [3.1]).

AC092957.1, although less well characterized in the literature, is co-enriched with these functionally relevant genes, suggesting that it may participate in regulatory networks that fine-tune gene expression, cell signaling, or chromatin organization pertinent to the complex hybrid state of these cells ([4.2]).

Collectively, the gene signature defined by POSTN, JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, AC092957.1, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT reveals a multifaceted cell state. These malignant astrocyte–gliosis–like cells exhibit properties of high invasiveness, metabolic flexibility, and adaptive intercellular communication that mirror both oncogenic transformation and the cellular programs normally active during neural development and reactive gliosis ([3.4], [2.1], JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, NAMPT, [5.1]). This duality not only accentuates their role in tumor progression but also underscores potential therapeutic vulnerabilities that stem from their recapitulation of both developmental and injury-response pathways.

   * Context: "The genes POSTN, JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT are enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells. Tenascin-C (TNC), one of these genes, is a matricellular extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein known to be multifunctional, with roles in modulating cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. Its expression is linked to glioma progression and gliomagenesis, as well as tissue injury, repair, and gliosis. TNC appears to interact dynamically within the glioma microenvironment, shaping the cancer cell niche. Studies show that TNC is expressed by neural stem/progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and is implicated in processes from normal brain development to pathological states including gliosis and neurodegeneration. Other genes like POSTN (periostin) are matricellular proteins contributing to ECM structure and remodeling, which influence cell adhesion and motility, important in glioma invasion and tumor progression. Additionally, IGFBP7 is involved in growth factor regulation, and COL23A1 is a collagen influencing ECM integrity. LAMA2 codes for laminin alpha-2, an ECM component regulating cell adhesion and migration, vital for neural development and tumor interactions. The presence of these genes reveals that the malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells have a state that reflects a complex interplay of cancerous behavior, reminiscent of reactive astrocytes (gliosis), and recapitulates aspects of normal neural development and tissue repair. This includes enhanced ECM remodeling, altered cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, immunomodulation, and stem/progenitor cell-like features. The gene expression profile suggests these cells contribute to creating a specialized tumor microenvironment that supports malignancy as well as interactions with other cells, including neural and immune cells, highlighting the intricate balance between cancer progression and the brain's intrinsic responses such as gliosis. The data indicate these glioblastoma cells may harness developmental pathways and ECM dynamics mediated by genes like TNC and POSTN to promote tumor growth and evade normal tissue regulation."

   * Context: "Among the queried genes, periostin (POSTN) is extensively studied and strongly associated with glioblastoma (GBM) malignancy. POSTN is highly expressed in GBM cells, especially glioma stem cells (GSCs). It plays critical roles in promoting tumor progression, including enhancing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance, partly through activation of NF-κB signaling and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotypes. POSTN also supports tumor angiogenesis via the CLOCK-POSTN-TBK1 axis and recruits tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), particularly the pro-tumoral M2 subtype, thereby shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME). High POSTN expression negatively correlates with patient overall survival and is enriched in mesenchymal GBM subtypes, which are prone to invasion and therapy resistance. POSTN influences multiple cell types in the GBM microenvironment by binding integrins (αVβ3 and αVβ5) and modulating macrophages and immune cells, including immunosuppressive microglia and regulatory T cells. Other genes like JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT were not directly linked to GBM in the Open Targets data but may contribute to cell-cell interactions, gliosis, or normal developmental processes given their functions: for example, JPH1 is involved in membrane junction formation, EYA4 in development and tumor progression, RTN1 in endoplasmic reticulum stress, LAMA2 in extracellular matrix and neural development, TNC as an ECM protein involved in gliosis and cancer invasion, IGFBP7 in growth regulation and angiogenesis, COL23A1 as a collagen variant potentially contributing to ECM remodeling, and NAMPT in metabolism and cell survival. In summary, the enrichment of these genes in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells suggests a state combining abnormal proliferation, enhanced invasiveness, gliosis-like reactive properties, involvement in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, modulation of the immune microenvironment, and engagement in developmental and repair pathways. POSTN emerges as a key mediator connecting these features by promoting malignancy, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and therapy resistance."

   *  Context: "The gene POSTN (periostin) is significantly upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM), particularly in malignant astrocyte-like glioblastoma cells, and is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics such as increased proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance. POSTN promotes tumor progression and temozolomide (TMZ) resistance by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This suggests that POSTN serves as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target and reflects malignant properties linked to tumor aggressiveness, stemness, and resistance to therapy. Although the excerpt mainly focuses on POSTN, the inclusion of genes such as LAMA2, TNC (tenascin C), IGFBP7, and COL23A1, which are extracellular matrix components or associated with cell adhesion and signaling, implies that these genes collectively relate to remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, cell adhesion, and cell-cell interactions that support glioma malignancy and gliosis-like reactive processes. Genes like NAMPT and EYA4 have roles in metabolism and development, respectively, indicating complex contributions to both tumor cell survival and potentially reactive or developmental states. Thus, the enrichment of these genes in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells reveals a cell state characterized by enhanced malignancy, therapeutic resistance, active EMT processes, extracellular matrix remodeling, and intricate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that resemble both cancerous and gliosis (reactive glial) phenotypes."

    * Context: "The genes POSTN, JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT are enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells and collectively indicate a complex state that integrates cancer progression, gliosis (reactive astrocyte-like response), normal developmental processes, and enhanced cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. POSTN (periostin) is a matricellular protein involved in multiple cancer-related functions such as tumor progression, chemoresistance, EMT, and invasion through integrin-mediated signaling pathways including NF-κB and TGF-β2, facilitating tumor progression and interaction with the tumor microenvironment. Other genes such as LAMA2 and TNC encode extracellular matrix proteins (laminin alpha 2, tenascin C) that contribute to matrix remodeling, a typical feature in gliosis and cancer invasion. RTN1 is involved in neural development. IGFBP7 is associated with growth factor binding affecting cell survival and proliferation. COL23A1 encodes collagen type XXIII alpha 1 chain, involved in ECM interactions. NAMPT is linked to metabolic regulation and cell survival. JPH1 plays roles in linking plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, influencing calcium signaling important for cell function. EYA4 functions in development and transcription regulation. This gene ensemble suggests that malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like cells have properties mirroring reactive astrocytes, showing both cancer-associated alterations and gliosis-like remodeling with significant influence on cell signaling, matrix interaction, immune modulation, and potentially therapeutic resistance. The involvement of periostin (POSTN) in recruiting tumor-associated macrophages and promoting angiogenesis aligns with a microenvironment-modifying, tumor-supportive phenotype. Thus, the genes highlight a malignant cell state combining cancer progression and reactive gliosis features, contributing to the dynamic interactions within the glioblastoma microenvironment and reflecting developmental, immune, and extracellular matrix remodeling processes."

    Context: "The gene POSTN (periostin), enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma (GBM) cells, is a secreted extracellular matrix protein crucially involved in tumor progression, chemoresistance, and cell-cell interactions. POSTN promotes GBM malignancy through mechanisms including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. Its overexpression is correlated with poorer patient survival and higher glioma grade, suggesting it as a prognostic biomarker. POSTN mediates tumor progression partly by recruiting tumor-associated macrophages (M2 type) and interacting with the perivascular microenvironment, such as pericytes, to promote angiogenesis. It acts in the tumor microenvironment by interacting with integrins, activating signaling pathways including NF-κB, which is important in cancer cell survival and chemo-resistance. POSTN activates NF-κB signaling by promoting IKKα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, releasing NF-κB, though the exact intermediary mechanisms remain unclear. NF-κB activation is linked with chemoresistance and tumor aggressiveness in multiple cancers including GBM. While POSTN's role is well studied, mechanisms linking it to other genes (like JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT) enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like cells remain less detailed, but they likely contribute similarly to glioma malignancy, cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix remodeling, and gliosis-related reactive states. The presence of these genes indicates a complex interplay between cancerous transformation and glia-like reactive states involving changes in cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix interaction, immune cell recruitment, and resistance to therapy, reflecting characteristics of both tumor progression and gliosis observed in brain tissue under pathological conditions. These gene enrichments reveal that malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells are in a highly active state involving cancer-related pathways, gliosis-associated reactive changes, and extensive cell-cell and tumor microenvironment interactions facilitating tumor growth and resistance to treatment."

    * Context: "The gene POSTN (periostin) is markedly upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) cells and patient samples, especially in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells. Increased POSTN expression is strongly linked with poor patient outcomes and higher WHO glioma grades. POSTN promotes tumor malignancy by enhancing proliferation, migration, invasion, self-renewal, and chemoresistance in GBM cells. Knockdown of POSTN reduces these malignant properties, while overexpression induces them. POSTN exerts its effects partly via activating NF-κB signaling and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), pathways associated with tumor progression and resistance. Other enriched genes in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells, such as JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT, are related to extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, and inflammation, indicating enhanced cell-cell interactions and tumor microenvironment remodeling akin to gliosis and normal developmental processes. These genes collectively suggest that the malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells embody properties of both aberrant tumorigenic transformation (via oncogenic signaling pathways like NF-κB and EMT) and reactive glial phenotypes (gliosis), highlighting a complex interplay between cancer progression, normal developmental pathways, and reactive gliosis involving extensive cell-cell interactions and extracellular matrix remodeling."

    * Context: "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumor characterized by aggressive invasion and therapy resistance, originating partly from glioblastoma stem-like cells. The transcription factor p73 promotes glioblastoma cell invasion by directly activating POSTN (periostin) expression. POSTN, an integrin-binding matricellular protein involved in metastasis, is a direct transcriptional target of TAp73 in glioblastoma. Knockdown of p73 reduced invasiveness, chemo-resistance, and promoted differentiation of glioblastoma cells into astrocyte-like morphologies, marked by increased GFAP expression. These findings indicate that the p73-POSTN axis supports the invasive, undifferentiated, stem-like state of glioblastoma cells, while loss of p73 promotes differentiation towards mature astrocytes. POSTN is implicated in extracellular matrix interactions, supporting cell adhesion and migration through integrin binding, which is important in cancer metastasis and tumor microenvironment remodeling. The enrichment of genes such as POSTN (periostin), JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC (tenascin C), IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells suggests these cells engage in active extracellular matrix remodeling, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and exhibit properties of both cancer progression and gliosis (a reactive state of astrocytes). For example, TNC and LAMA2 are extracellular matrix proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration; IGFBP7 is linked to growth factor signaling modulation; NAMPT is related to metabolism and survival; EYA4 and RTN1 participate in neuronal development and response to injury. These gene enrichments reveal that malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells are in a plastic, reactive state combining aspects of normal development, gliosis, and cancerous invasiveness. Their expression profile reflects a hybrid cell state that contributes to tumor aggressiveness via enhanced migratory and invasive capacity, resistance to therapy, and potential to modulate their microenvironment through matrix remodeling and altered signaling. Overall, the presence and regulation of these genes in glioblastoma emphasize the complex interplay between tumorigenesis, cell differentiation state, gliosis, and extracellular interactions driving malignant progression."

    * Context: "The genes POSTN, JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT are enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells and collectively reveal a complex profile associated with both cancer progression and the neural environment. POSTN (periostin) is directly activated by the transcription factor p73 in glioblastoma cells, leading to increased cell invasion and migration through pathways involving integrin and fibronectin binding, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix interactions. High POSTN expression correlates with poor survival in glioblastoma patients, indicating its critical role in tumor aggressiveness. These genes relate to processes such as glioblastoma cell differentiation, invasion, and mesenchymal transition. For example, p73 loss leads to a differentiated state with reduced migration and invasion, partly by downregulating POSTN and EMT markers like SNAIL, and upregulating epithelial markers like E-cadherin. The gene expression changes implicate pathways essential for cell mobility, adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, and invasion, which are fundamental both for glioblastoma malignancy and normal neural development or gliosis. Some genes (e.g., TNC and LAMA2) are involved in extracellular matrix composition and cell adhesion, affecting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that facilitate invasion and migration. Other genes like IGFBP7 and NAMPT play additional roles in cell growth regulation and metabolism, potentially supporting tumor progression. The enrichment of these genes underscores the complex interplay between malignant transformation processes, gliosis (reactive astrocyte activation), and normal brain development pathways in glioblastoma cells that exhibit astrocyte-like and gliosis-like features."

Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research : CR (2024). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-024-03175-9
    * Context: "The gene POSTN plays a central role in glioblastoma (GBM), particularly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and their interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME). POSTN activates signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/β-catenin/FOSL1 to promote GSC self-renewal and tumor growth. It also recruits microglia and modulates their phenotype to an immunosuppressive state by increasing immune checkpoint molecules like CD70 via the PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathway, facilitating tumor progression through immune evasion. While the specific roles of other genes like JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells are not detailed in the excerpt, POSTN exemplifies how genes enriched in such cells can regulate both intrinsic cancer properties (e.g., stemness, proliferation) and extrinsic interactions (immune modulation via microglia recruitment and immunosuppressive phenotype induction). This suggests that the enriched gene set likely reflects a state involving malignant transformation, mimicry or influence on normal developmental and gliosis processes, and active modulation of cell-cell interactions within the GBM microenvironment to support cancer progression and therapeutic resistance."

Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research : CR (2024). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-024-03175-9
   * Context: "The gene POSTN (periostin), identified as highly expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), plays a dual role in promoting both the maintenance of GSCs and the immunosuppressive phenotype of microglia within glioblastoma (GBM). POSTN is secreted by GSCs and activates signaling pathways (αVβ3/PI3K/AKT/β-catenin/FOSL1) that enhance GSC self-renewal and tumor growth, indicating its importance in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. In addition to its intrinsic effects on GSCs, POSTN recruits immunosuppressive microglia by upregulating CD70 expression via the αVβ3/PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathway, which promotes regulatory T cell (Treg) development and establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While POSTN’s role in cancer and immune modulation is detailed, the other genes listed (JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, NAMPT) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt, but their co-enrichment in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells likely reflects a complex cellular state combining features of aberrant cancer progression, astrocyte activation (gliosis), processes active in normal development, and cell-cell interactions within the TME. Given POSTN’s involvement in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and signaling and its low expression in normal tissues versus high in GBM, the enrichment of these genes suggests that the malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like cells possess properties that support cancer stem cell maintenance, immune evasion, activated gliosis-like phenotypes, and dynamic interactions with microglia and other immune cells, contributing to tumor malignancy and an immunosuppressive microenvironment."

Hu, Xianjin Chen, Xinmin Liu, Qinghua Zhang, You Zuo. Journal of Molecular Neuroscience (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-021-01832-8
   * Context: "The gene tenascin-C (TNC), enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like glioblastoma cells along with POSTN, JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT, is an extracellular matrix protein known to modulate cellular behaviors associated with glioma malignancy. TNC promotes glioma cell malignant behaviors such as enhanced invasion, angiogenesis, and migration, while also inhibiting chemosensitivity to agents like paclitaxel via activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This suggests that TNC and its co-enriched genes reflect a malignant state with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Additionally, TNC has immunomodulatory roles in neuroinflammation and influences tumor microenvironment interactions, highlighting the dynamic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the glioma context. TNC expression is linked to promotion of cancer stemness through pathways like Akt/HIF1a, and it is involved in both tumor progression and modulation of repair-like processes resembling gliosis. The enrichment of TNC and related genes may thus indicate a convergence of malignant transformation with normal developmental and gliotic mechanisms, where extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion (via integrins), and signaling pathways facilitating cell survival, proliferation, migration, and resistance to therapy are engaged. Overall, the gene signature including TNC reveals a cell state that integrates cancerous, developmental, and reactive glial programs, contributing to tumor progression and interaction with the microenvironment and immune cells."

POSTN and COL23A1 are involved in cancer-associated fibroblast features and extracellular matrix interactions, respectively, suggesting roles in tumor microenvironment and cancer progression. TNC (tenascin C) and LAMA2 are extracellular matrix components linked to reactive astrocyte gliosis, showing a relationship to normal glial scar formation and injury response. IGFBP7 and NAMPT are implicated in cell metabolism and cancer-related pathways, highlighting altered metabolic and survival features in malignant astrocytes. EYA4 and RTN1, associated with neurodevelopment and endoplasmic reticulum function respectively, imply influence on cell differentiation and stress responses. JPH1, important for cell signaling and communication, suggests enhanced cell-cell interactions and possibly altered intracellular calcium dynamics in these glioblastoma cells.

IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) relates to cell growth regulation, while NAMPT is connected to metabolic regulation and cellular stress responses. The expression of these genes suggests glioblastoma cells adopt a reactive astrocyte-like state involving ECM remodeling, increased cell-cell signaling, and interactions that may promote tumor invasion and gliosis-like responses in the CNS. This gene set collectively reflects the complex interplay between malignancy and astrocyte biology, highlighting pathways that influence tumor microenvironment, cancer cell behavior, and disrupted CNS homeostasis."

   * Context: "The study by Mega et al. identifies an astrocyte gene signature associated with poor survival in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), particularly enriched in the mesenchymal subtype. Among genes upregulated in GBM-exposed astrocytes, POSTN and SRGN stand out, showing higher expression in astrocyte signature-high patient groups and correlating with shorter survival. These genes are implicated in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and stress response, highlighting a tumor-supportive role of astrocytes. While specific mention of JPH1, EYA4, RTN1, LAMA2, TNC, IGFBP7, COL23A1, and NAMPT is not directly present in the provided text, the overall thematic focus suggests that genes enriched in astrocyte-like glioblastoma cells reflect an activated, reactive state resembling gliosis and contribute to the malignant phenotype through promoting cell-cell interactions, extracellular matrix remodeling, and tumor progression. Co-culture experiments confirm that GBM cells induce specific gene expression changes in astrocytes, transforming them into tumor-supportive cells. Higher astrocyte signature scores correlate with stromal abundance but are independently predictive of poor prognosis. Additionally, genes such as POSTN and SRGN are induced by astrocytes and involved in extracellular matrix interactions and cell migration, suggesting these genes mediate crosstalk between astrocytes and GBM cells, driving aggressiveness of the tumor. Overall, the gene set enriched in malignant astrocyte-gliosis-like GBM cells indicates enhanced proliferative, migratory, and interactive properties, linked to both cancer progression and reactive astrocyte states resembling normal and pathological gliosis."
