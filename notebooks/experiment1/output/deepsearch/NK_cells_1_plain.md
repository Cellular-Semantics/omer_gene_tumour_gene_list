# plain query NK cells 1

Query: What might the following enriched gene lists say about the type, properties and cell-cell interactions of the cells the list was derived from ['SKAP1', 'CD247', 'PARP8', 'PTPRC', 'PRKCH', 'SYTL3', 'CD96', 'IQGAP2', 'CBLB', 'MCTP2']

<think>
We are given a list of genes: ['SKAP1', 'CD247', 'PARP8', 'PTPRC', 'PRKCH', 'SYTL3', 'CD96', 'IQGAP2', 'CBLB', 'MCTP2']
 We need to infer the type, properties, and cell-cell interactions of the cells from which this gene list was derived.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the function of each gene and its typical expression in cell types.
 2. Look for patterns that point to a specific cell type or function.
 3. Consider the roles of these genes in cellular processes, especially in the immune system (since many of these genes are immune-related).

 Let's break down the genes:

 - SKAP1: Adapter protein involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It regulates T-cell adhesion and activation.
 - CD247: Also known as CD3ζ, a component of the TCR complex. Essential for T-cell activation and signaling.
 - PARP8: Member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family. Less studied, but may be involved in DNA damage response and possibly in immune regulation.
 - PTPRC: Also known as CD45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C. It is a key regulator of T- and B-cell receptor signaling. Expressed on all nucleated hematopoietic cells (leukocytes).
 - PRKCH: Protein kinase C eta type. Involved in cell signaling, including in T-cells and in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.
 - SYTL3: Synaptotagmin-like protein 3. Involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. Expressed in immune cells and may regulate cytotoxic granule exocytosis in T-cells and NK cells.
 - CD96: T-cell activation, increased expression after activation. Also expressed on NK cells and involved in cell adhesion and activation.
 - IQGAP2: IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 2. Regulates cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Expressed in various tissues, but also in hematopoietic cells.
 - CBLB: Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b. E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates T-cell activation. Critical for maintaining T-cell tolerance and preventing autoimmunity.
 - MCTP2: Multiple C2 and transmembrane domain containing 2. Function not well characterized, but may be involved in calcium signaling and is expressed in the brain and immune cells.

 Pattern:
 The list is dominated by genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling and T-cell activation (SKAP1, CD247, PTPRC, PRKCH, CD96, CBLB). Additionally, SYTL3 is involved in cytotoxic granule exocytosis, which is a function of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.

 Specific cell type inference:
 - T-cells: CD247 (TCR component), SKAP1 (TCR signaling), PTPRC (CD45, expressed on T-cells), CD96 (T-cell activation), CBLB (T-cell tolerance).
 - NK cells: SYTL3 (cytotoxicity), CD96 (also on NK cells).

 However, note that:
  - PTPRC (CD45) is a pan-leukocyte marker, but its presence confirms hematopoietic origin.
  - The absence of B-cell specific markers (like CD19, CD20) and the presence of T-cell/NK markers suggests T or NK lineage.

 Moreover, the presence of genes involved in negative regulation (CBLB) and activation (SKAP1, CD247) suggests a T-cell with a regulatory or activated phenotype. Also, the inclusion of PRKCH (PKCη) which is involved in T-cell signaling and differentiation, and SYTL3 which is involved in exocytosis (cytolytic function), points to a cytotoxic T-cell or NK cell.

 Cell properties and interactions:
 - The cells are likely adaptive immune cells (T-cells) or innate immune cells (NK cells) with cytotoxic potential.
 - They are involved in cell-mediated immunity, with the ability to recognize and kill target cells (via TCR or NK receptors) and to form immune synapses (cell-cell interactions).
 - The presence of adhesion molecules (CD96, IQGAP2) and signaling molecules (SKAP1, CD247, PTPRC, PRKCH) suggests active cell-cell interactions, such as between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells or between cytotoxic cells and their targets.

 Conclusion:
 The gene list is enriched for genes involved in T-cell signaling and activation, with some overlap in NK cell function. The cells are likely T-cells (possibly cytotoxic T-cells) or NK cells. 

 Properties:
 - They are immune cells with cytotoxic potential (due to SYTL3 and CD96).
 - They are involved in cell-mediated cytotoxicity and adaptive immunity (if T-cells) or innate immunity (if NK cells).
 - They exhibit activation and adhesion properties (CD96, IQGAP2) and are regulated by both positive (TCR signaling) and negative (CBLB) signals.

 Cell-cell interactions:
 - They interact with antigen-presenting cells (via TCR-MHC) or with target cells (via cytotoxic receptors).
 - The adhesion molecules (CD96, IQGAP2) and signaling molecules (SKAP1, CD247) facilitate immune synapse formation.

 Therefore, the cells are likely cytotoxic T cells or NK cells, with a gene expression profile indicating activation, adhesion, and cytotoxic function.
