# contextual query Endothelial (CNA-associated)

Query: The following is a list of genes enriched in tumour microenvironment cells from a (human) patient with glioblastoma  annotated as Vascular-associated.  What might this list say about the state, properties and interactions of this cell type?  Do not limit your answers to the cancer literature,  include normal cell-cell interactions, development and cross-cutting metabolic states.  Gene list: ['IGFBP7', 'VWF', 'PTPRG', 'PTPRZ1', 'EGFR', 'GALNT18', 'ABCB1', 'ANGPT2', 'SPARC', 'PLEKHG1']

The enrichment of the following genes—**IGFBP7**, **VWF**, **PTPRG**, **PTPRZ1**, **EGFR**, **GALNT18**, **ABCB1**, **ANGPT2**, **SPARC**, and **PLEKHG1**—in vascular-associated cells from the tumour microenvironment of a glioblastoma patient provides insight into both the specialized **state** of these cells and their **functional properties** within the tumour and in normal physiology.

**Key inferences about the state and properties of these vascular-associated cells:**

- **Angiogenic activity and endothelial specialization:**
  - **VWF (Von Willebrand Factor)** is a classic marker of **endothelial cells**, specifically those involved in hemostasis and vessel integrity; its expression indicates the presence of mature or activated vascular endothelial cells.
  - **ANGPT2 (Angiopoietin-2)** is a key regulator of vascular remodeling and destabilization, often upregulated in angiogenic blood vessels particularly within tumours, facilitating vessel sprouting and plasticity.
  - **SPARC (Secreted Protein, Acidic and Rich in Cysteine)** is involved in matrix remodeling and modulates cell-matrix interactions, supporting angiogenesis and vessel maturation.
  - **IGFBP7** has roles in endothelial cell senescence, vascular permeability, and modulation of angiogenic responses, relevant for both normal and tumour-associated vasculature.

- **Abnormal vascular function and adaptation to the tumour microenvironment:**
  - **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)** is not only an oncogenic driver in glioblastoma cells but is also expressed in tumour-associated endothelial cells, where it can promote proliferation and abnormal vessel formation.
  - **ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1)** is a transporter highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier and in tumour endothelium, contributing to drug efflux and **chemoresistance**; its upregulation suggests functional barrier properties and metabolic adaptation.
  - **ANGPT2** and **SPARC** together signal **remodeling** and increased permeability, both hallmarks of tumour-associated vasculature that allow for tumour cell invasion and immune cell infiltration.

- **Cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling:**
  - **PTPRG** and **PTPRZ1** are receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases; both are involved in **cell signaling** that regulates endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and interactions with neural or glial cells. **PTPRZ1** is highly expressed in the brain and implicated in both development and repair, mediating interactions with the extracellular matrix.
  - **GALNT18** is an enzyme involved in protein glycosylation, which can modulate the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules, thus affecting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during vascular growth and remodeling.
  - **PLEKHG1** is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that contributes to cytoskeletal dynamics, crucial for endothelial cell migration and vessel sprouting.

**Broader context beyond cancer:**
- These genes are not solely tumour-associated; their expression reflects roles in **normal development** (e.g., neurovascular unit formation, neurogenesis-associated angiogenesis), physiological responses to injury (e.g., vessel reactivity, repair after ischemia), and **blood-brain barrier (BBB)** function.
- For example, **VWF, ANGPT2, and SPARC** are upregulated during **developmental angiogenesis**, while **ABCB1** ensures BBB selectivity throughout life.
- **PTPRZ1** is particularly enriched in the **nervous system**, mediating cross-talk between glia, neurons, and vessels during brain maturation and synaptic plasticity.

**Metabolic and adaptive states:**
- The presence of **ABCB1** and upregulation of **ANGPT2** and **SPARC** suggest adaptation to **hypoxic, nutrient-deprived, or inflammatory microenvironments**, typical of rapidly growing tumours or wound-healing responses.
- **IGFBP7** and **SPARC** are associated with cellular senescence or stress responses, which may reflect an adaptive mechanism to the oxidative and metabolic stress prevalent in tumour microenvironments.

**Summary Table: Gene Functions and Implications**

| Gene      | Normal Function | Role in TME/GBM | Interaction/Implication |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| IGFBP7    | Vascular homeostasis, senescence | Angiogenesis, barrier function | Endothelial stress, matrix signaling |
| VWF       | Hemostasis, endothelial marker | Tumour vasculature integrity | Endothelial cell identity |
| PTPRG     | Signal regulation | Migration, vascular stability | Endothelial signaling |
| PTPRZ1    | CNS development | Glioma-endothelial signaling | Neuronal-vascular communication |
| EGFR      | Cell growth regulator | Endothelial proliferation | Abnormal vessel growth |
| GALNT18   | Glycosylation enzyme | Matrix modulation | Cell-cell/matrix interaction |
| ABCB1     | Drug efflux, BBB | Chemoresistance | Barrier adaptation |
| ANGPT2    | Vascular morphogenesis | Vessel plasticity | Angiogenic switch |
| SPARC     | ECM remodeling | Permeability, invasion | Matrix turnover |
| PLEKHG1   | Cytoskeletal regulation | Migration | Vascular sprouting |

**In essence**, this gene expression profile suggests highly active, plastic, and *abnormally remodeled endothelial cells* or vascular-associated stromal cells that are not only supporting angiogenesis and tumour growth, but are also preserving aspects of BBB function and engaging in complex, adaptive signaling with the TME and neural tissue. These properties reflect both developmental and pathological vessel biology, highlighting shared features between tumour angiogenesis and normal vascular adaptation, as well as dynamic cross-talk with surrounding non-vascular cells.
